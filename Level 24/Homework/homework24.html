    <h1>On this website we are going to talk about HTML: 
    <img src="/Level 24/html.png" height="100"></h1>
    <h2>
        HTML is like the skeleton of a body. It tells web browsers how to 
        display content like text, images, and links on a webpage.
        It's the foundation of every website we see on the internet.</h1>
    <p>Now, we are using paragraph tag.</p>
    <b>This is bold tag</b>
    <button>Click me</button> <i>this is button tag we can click that button.
        also we can link some websites or whatever we want(this is itilacized text).
    </i>
    <h3>as you can see the text above me is too long. <br> we can use break tag, which means that it tells <br>the browser to start a new line after the <br>br tag </h3>
   <br> <p>Now lets improve "Click me" button and add link on it</p>
   <button><a href="https://github.com/sixa2/GOA">Click me</a></button>
    <i>It is link of my github. we just use "a href" which is anchor tag.</i>
